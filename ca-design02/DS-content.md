--- Buttons ----
Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

.btn--primary - the main call-to-action button style.For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen (not including the application header or in a modal dialog).

.btn--secondary → a subtle style version, used for secondary actions or in combo with the primary/accent button.

For secondary actions on each page; these can only be used in conjunction with a primary button

Ghost - For the least pronounced actions; often used in conjunction with a primary button.

When to use
Use buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact with the page. Each page should have one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons


The most important thing is to establish a visual hierarchy between the buttons in your UI. 

--- Links ----

Links are used as navigational elements. They may appear on their own, within a sentence or paragraph, or directly following the content.


Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

When to use
Use links when you want users to:

Navigate to a different page within the application
Navigate to an entirely different site
Jump to an element on the same page
Link to emails or phone numbers.

Inline links are used within a sentence or paragraph and are styled with an underline. They should not be paired with an icon.

Independent links:
These links are the default link type. They are used on their own or directly following content and they do not use underlines. They can be paired with an icon (arrow).

--- IMAGES -----

The result is exclusive snapshots of authentic situations, perfectly pairing sophisticated lighting with a subtle colour mood.

Aspect ratio
Photography
The aspect ratio for photographs should be 3:2.

Alternative text
All images, except decorative images, must have alt text that:

tells people what information the image provides
describes the content and function of the image
is specific, meaningful and concise
Use normal punctuation, like commas and full stops, so the text is easy to read and understand.

Images with tex:
Use overlay so the text visible, readily is more important.

For icons and illustrations, I find using a vector format (SVG) works best for scalability and responsive design. However, if you find yourself needing to use photography, you may need to use a rasterized image format like JPG or PNG.
