--- Color Scheme ----
Jurk has three main colors in they design system. Purple as primary color, black and white as both secondary and complementary colors. 
Black and cloud is the mainly used and therefore has, while purple is used for important areas and areas of focus. 

Context and content is what matters essencially and colors is there to give and support the message. 



Dark blue
The Jurk primary color is primarily used areas where attention and  differentiation is important.

Many Western cultures use blue for bank logos because it represents trust and authority.



Black
Depending on the colors used with it, black can be elegant and traditional, or modern and edgy.
Black is a strong color often associated with sophistication, elegance, authority, power, sleekness, stability, strength, formality, and intelligence. 



Cloud
White is associated with purity, cleanliness, virtue, happiness, sincerity, and safety.

White is associated with purity, cleanliness, virtue, happiness, sincerity, and safety.

Grey is associated with formality, professionalism, sophistication, practicality, timelessness, and strong character.
 to create a balancing, calming effect.
For functional applications, the colour palette can be extended to include grey tones ranging from white to black.


We use grey most of the time to calm down the boldness of
the other colors. It is generally used as a background color.

White fulfills several tasks. It defines spaces, balances out other colors. 

--- Pattern ----

 subtle pattern that is paired with lots of whitespace. It is used only in one section; nevertheless, that’s enough to enhance the aesthetics as well as provide extra emphasis. The projects feel refreshing, elegant and sophisticated.

gives the design a modern twist.

Can be used with text, where the text has solid background color or its image, but with a head and cta.

--- Typography ----

Our brand font, Mary Ann, is used for display (headings, labels, in CTAs and links, etc), with Arial being used for all other applications.

The typography can be applied in either black or white. Grey scales are possible in the digital context for functional reasons. Type sizes, line spacing and the distance between the text hierarchies can be freely selected. Audi Type Extended is used for headlines and sublines.

Example article
When displaying a page with large blocks of text content you should limit the line length to around 75 characters and keep your copy left aligned. Heading margins can also be changed to have larger spacing from the content above compared to it’s related content below.


--- Buttons ----
Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

.btn--primary - the main call-to-action button style.For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen (not including the application header or in a modal dialog).

.btn--secondary → a subtle style version, used for secondary actions or in combo with the primary/accent button.

For secondary actions on each page; these can only be used  in conjunction with a primary button

Ghost - For the least pronounced actions; often used in conjunction with a primary button.

When to use
Use buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact with the page. Each page should have one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons


The most important thing is to establish a visual hierarchy between the buttons in your UI. 

--- Links ----

Links are used as navigational elements. They may appear on their own, within a sentence or paragraph, or directly following the content.


Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

When to use
Use links when you want users to:

Navigate to a different page within the application
Navigate to an entirely different site
Jump to an element on the same page
Link to emails or phone numbers.

Inline links are used within a sentence or paragraph and are styled with an underline. They should not be paired with an icon.

Independent links:
These links are the default link type. They are used on their own or directly following content and they do not use underlines. They can be paired with an icon (arrow).

--- IMAGES -----

The result is exclusive snapshots of authentic situations, perfectly pairing sophisticated lighting with a subtle colour mood.

Aspect ratio
Photography
The aspect ratio for photographs should be 3:2.

Alternative text
All images, except decorative images, must have alt text that:

tells people what information the image provides
describes the content and function of the image
is specific, meaningful and concise
Use normal punctuation, like commas and full stops, so the text is easy to read and understand.

Images with tex:
Use overlay so the text visible, readily is more important.

For icons and illustrations, I find using a vector format (SVG) works best for scalability and responsive design. However, if you find yourself needing to use photography, you may need to use a rasterized image format like JPG or PNG.
