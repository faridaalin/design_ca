--- Links ----

Links are used as navigational elements. They may appear on their own, within a sentence or paragraph, or directly following the content.


Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

When to use
Use links when you want users to:

Navigate to a different page within the application
Navigate to an entirely different site
Jump to an element on the same page
Link to emails or phone numbers.

Inline links are used within a sentence or paragraph and are styled with an underline. They should not be paired with an icon.

Independent links:
These links are the default link type. They are used on their own or directly following content and they do not use underlines. They can be paired with an icon (arrow).

--- IMAGES -----

The result is exclusive snapshots of authentic situations, perfectly pairing sophisticated lighting with a subtle colour mood.

Aspect ratio
Photography
The aspect ratio for photographs should be 3:2.

Alternative text
All images, except decorative images, must have alt text that:

tells people what information the image provides
describes the content and function of the image
is specific, meaningful and concise
Use normal punctuation, like commas and full stops, so the text is easy to read and understand.

Images with tex:
Use overlay so the text visible, readily is more important.

For icons and illustrations, I find using a vector format (SVG) works best for scalability and responsive design. However, if you find yourself needing to use photography, you may need to use a rasterized image format like JPG or PNG.
